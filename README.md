An implementation of the adaline neuron in python.

As per the schematic above the neuron must calculate a summation of weighted inputs, implement an activation function (minimum loss function with gradient decent), recalculate weights, and make predictions. 

To use this neuron simply import the python file and use class AdalineGD.
